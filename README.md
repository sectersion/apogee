## Budget

- $500-$800
- Will request grant from Austin Amateur Radio Club and if that doesn't work out we will do more research
## Description

### Feature List
- camera
- Meshtastic node (RAK or similar)
- APRS radio equipment
- power system with LiPo battery
### Flight info:
- 25km-35km for good line of sight, 30km better if we're trying to beat 200mi
- Flight time of 2-3 hours (~1.5 burst time)
- Should give us ~40mins or so I think where we could contact it

### Heating:
- Atmosphere is only about 1% at 30km so this is not too much of an issue
- Most people just rely on the passive heating from components dissipating power which should be fine for us too (meshtastic is about 200-600mW non emited)
- We can throw some chemical hand warmers in too for backup
- Everything will be enclosed in a Styrofoam box, this has worked for many

### Battery:
- A good bit of the projects I've looked at have recommended Lithium AA/AAA batteries (such as L91 AAs) as they have good temperature stability/can hold their capacity
- We will still have separate circuits on separate batteries for redundancy

### Legality:
- As long as we keep the payload <4lbs we shouldn't need to file anything
- We will still need to alert FAA 6-24hr before launch, this is not asking for permission though just letting them know
- Aircraft Club can double check this stuff if they help out, all radio stuff will be within legal power

### Launching:
- We will do at least one practice flight/full simulation somehow to test everything and ensure we can find it (even if we just stash it somewhere)
- On the big day, we will have a launch/retrieval team, and two teams with nodes far away (maybe one to beat ground-air and one to attempt overall 200mi)
